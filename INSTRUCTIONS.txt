INSTRUCTIONS

To skip the starting animation press "s".
To move the squares use the arrow keys.

Game logic:
Each square that "bumps" into a square with the same number adds to it.
(Ex: square 4 bumps into square 4. Both become a new square 8.)
Goal: Reach square 2048.
Game over: When there are no possible moves, the game ends.
